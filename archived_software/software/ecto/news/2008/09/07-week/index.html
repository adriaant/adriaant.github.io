                              <p>Reblogged from <a href="../../../../../../2008/09/passing-the-torch/index.html">infinite-sushi.com</a>:</p>
<p>After 6 years of developing, maintaining and improving ecto, I felt it was time to move on. From now on, the new owner of ecto will be <a href="http://illumineX.com">illumineX, inc</a>. Instead of one guy working on your favorite blog client part-time, you'll now have a team of developers working on ecto full time. Before I decided to sell ecto, I had a long correspondence with Gary Longsine, the CEO of illumineX. I wanted to make sure it will continue to be in good hands. I found Gary to be a great guy and he convinced me that his team has many new ideas that will keep ecto growing in functionality and power. In fact, they have already developed a blog client for iPhone based on ecto's code base. I helped out with a few tricky XML-RPC and Atom issues and I was very impressed with how quick the illumineX team picks up things and how fast they work.</p>
<p>I will remain involved with ecto as a consultant and it's very likely I will develop custom plugins (I already wrote an <a href="../../08/itunes_add-on.php.html" rel="tag">iTunes plugin</a>). I will always be a fervent user of ecto, so obviously I'd like to see it continue the excellent job it's been doing. You will also still find me in the support forum.<br></p>
<p>It does feel odd to let go of something that has been my flagship product and my precious for so long. I put many hours in it and I take much pride in having created ecto. But it remains in capable hands and I now have the opportunity to spend my free time on new things.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the transfer of ecto to illumineX, feel free to post them in the comments section of the <a href="../../../../../../2008/09/passing-the-torch/index.html">original post</a>.</p>
